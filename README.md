# General-Python-Scripts
Contains python scripts I've created for tasks unrelated to GIS.

I'm so new to coding that I decided to create a GitHub account in order to show the world my first independently developed python script that actually accomplishes a task I need to do in the real-world (MyDateUpdate.py script). It's not very relevant to others, but it works well for me and my existing work systems. I'm so proud of it!

And I've made some modifications to my first script to allow it to process more than one type of file extension, which I feel constitutes a new enough version to give the script a "2.0" designation (MyDateUpdate2.py).  :)
