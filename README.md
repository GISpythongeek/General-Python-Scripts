# General-Python-Scripts
Contains python scripts I've created for tasks unrelated to GIS.

I'm so new to coding that I decided to create a GitHub account and show the world my first independently developed python script that actually accomplishes a task I need to do in the real-world (MyDateUpdate.py script). It's not very relevant to others (yet!), but it works well for me and my existing work systems. I'm so proud of it!
